## Problem
Write a program that prompts the user to input the names of five Pokemon. Store those Pokemon in an array, and randomly select one to print out.
HINT: Don’t reinvent the wheel — a function already exists that will return a random number!

## Sample Run
```bash
~/workspace/ python pokemon.py
Give me a Pokemon: Butterfree
Give me a Pokemon: Clefairy
Give me a Pokemon: Diglett
Give me a Pokemon: Growlithe
Give me a Pokemon: Rapidash
Clefairy, I choose you!
```
