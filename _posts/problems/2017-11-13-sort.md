## Problem
We're going to write a sorting algorithm in Python! This one is called bubble sort. It's one of many different ways to sort values! The way we sorted each other in class is an example of bubble sort! The highest values "bubble" to the top.

Write a program that asks a user for values, stores them in a list, sorts that list(without using `sort()`!), then prints the list!

## TODOs
- Get input from user to build list
  - HINT: a `while` loop could prove useful to mimic the behavior in the sample Run
- Sort the list using bubble sort
  - HINT 1: You are going to need nested for loops
  - HINT 2: Check if current element in array is greater than next element (i.e. out of order!) and then swap!
  - HINT 3: Remember, swapping requires a `temp` variable
- Print the sorted list!

## Sample Run
```bash
~/workspace/ python bubblesort.py
Give me a value (type STOP to end): 2
Give me a value (type STOP to end): 17
Give me a value (type STOP to end): 1
Give me a value (type STOP to end): 8
Give me a value (type STOP to end): 27
Give me a value (type STOP to end): STOP
[1, 2, 8, 17, 27]
```
