## Purpose

Computer Science boils down to problem solving, as does entrepreneurialism. The best way to both learn something and to check for understanding is to create. For the last month of class, we will be creating something!

## Requirements

1. Must be more profound than problems we've tackled during the semester
2. It should fall into one of the following listed options

## Options

1. Video Game
  - I have some Python book references for this
2. iOS App
  - Will require to [download Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and learn a language called Swift (very similar to Python)
  - [Here are some resources for creating an iOS app on Xcode](https://codewithchris.com/how-to-make-iphone-apps-with-no-programming-experience/)
3. Another Python Program Ran Via the Command Line
  - You will need to make sure it is more interesting that problems we've done in class
