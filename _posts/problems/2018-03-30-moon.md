## Gravity0.py: The Man on the Moon
If you were standing on the moon right now, your weight would be 16.5 percent of what it is on Earth. You can calculate that by multiplying your Earth weight by 0.165.

If you gained a kilo in weight every year for the next 15 years, what would your weight be when you visited the moon each year and at the end of the 15 years? Write a program called **gravity0.py** that asks a user for his/her weight and uses a for loop that prints his/her moon weight for each year.

### Submission
Head to [CS50.io](cs50.io) Make sure **gravity0.py** is in your current directory and type `submit50 compsci.one/review/gravity0@spencertiberi/checks` in the terminal.

#### Topics Covered
- variables
- floats
- simple i/o
- for loops

## Gravity1.py: Standing on the Shoulders of the Moon
In the last programming problem you created a for loop to determine your weight on the moon over a period of 15 years. That for loop could easily be turned into a function. Try creating a function that takes a starting weight and the gravity percentage (be sure to now prompt the use for the percentage as well!). You might call the new function using code like this: `moon_weight(30, 0.25)`. Save this new version of the program as **gravity1.py**.

### Submission
Head to [CS50.io](cs50.io) Make sure **gravity.py** is in your current directory and type `submit50 compsci.one/review/gravity1@spencertiberi/checks` in the terminal.

#### Topics Covered
- variables
- floats
- simple i/o
- for loops
- functions

## Gravity2.py: Time on the Moon
Take the function that you've just created, and change it to work out the weight over different periods, such as 5 years or 20 years. Be sure to change the function so that it takes three arguments (and that you prompt the user for the three arguments!): initial weight, gravity percentage, and number of years. The function could be called as such `moon_weight(90, 0.25, 5)`. Save this new program as **gravity2.py**.
