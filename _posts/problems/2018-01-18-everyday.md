# How do you do...

Here's some practice to help you sharpen your pseudocode. In a .txt file named **everyday.txt**, write pseudocode describing how to do the following ordinary, everyday processes. Be specific! You would want to make it so that a stranger could reasonably follow your directions.

1. Brushing your teeth
2. Creating and sending a snap to your friend (You're **NOT** allowed to go through the steps right now! ðŸ‘€)
3. How you get to Belmont Hill from your house in the morning

# How to Submit

Be sure you have an edX.org account set up and you've visited [cs50.io](cs50.io) before next class! We'll submit it in class so make sure it's finished or that will be super awkward!
