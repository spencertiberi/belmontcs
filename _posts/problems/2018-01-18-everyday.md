# Setup

Make a file called `binary.txt` in the [CS50 IDE](cs50.io). You may want to do so using the super cool command `touch binary.txt` in the terminal!

# Problems

1. Write 101 in decimal (base 10).
2. Write 10001011 in decimal (base 10).
3. Write 13 in binary.
4. Write 182 in binary.
5. In decimal, what's the biggest number you can represent with 8 bits (binary digits)?
6. Evaluate 101 + 1 in binary.
7. Evaluate 10111 + 10010 in binary.

# How to Submit

Head to [CS50.io](cs50.io) Make sure binary.txt is in your current directory and type `submit50 compsci.one/binary@spencertiberi/checks` into the terminal.
