## Let's Make a Website!

Phew... Let do this, shall we? Your assignment is simply to create a web page. You should have one HTML file (named whatever you’d like, **but be sure to save it in a folder called "html"**!) containing the web page’s structure, and one CSS file for styling. Other than that, there are no restrictions on other things you’d like to include.

Feel free to be creative with this assignment. Make something that is meaningful to you - it could be a blog post, a pseudo-shopping website, or a family tree. The sky is the limit! At the bare minimum, your page MUST include the following:

- A table
- A link to an external website
- A button (which needn’t actually have a function, but should exist on the page)
- At least two divs, with div IDs
- A list
- A heading
- A paragraph
- At least three images, either externally linked or contained within your ~/workspace/html directory
- At least one block of text that is not left-aligned
- At least two different fonts
- At least three different colors of text
- At least two other extra features, one in HTML and one in CSS

Of course, you can do many more of each of the above; and to make a neat website, you’ll have to!

Because this assignment will result in something different for each person, there’s no check50 for this one. Make sure that you’ve included everything listed above and you have no broken links or permission issues and you should be good to go.

## Submission

To submit, be sure you are in your `html` directory and run `submit50 cs50/2017/ap/chapter5`.
