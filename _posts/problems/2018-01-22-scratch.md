# Itching to Program?

Let's make a project in Scratch. Shall we?

We'll dive into concepts of programming using Scratch to help us learn useful skills and foster our creativity.

Feel free to head to [http://scratch.mit.edu/help/](http://scratch.mit.edu/help/) and take note of the resources available to you before you dive into Scratch itself. In particular, you might want to skim the Getting Started Guide.

## Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

To get a feel for some projects made in the past, head to [http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/26329354/](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/26329354/) to see Pikachu’s Pastry Catch by Gabe Walker. Click the blue square above the game’s top-left corner if you’d like to full-screen the user interface (UI). Then click the green flag. Per Gabe’s instructions, as soon as you hit your keyboard’s space bar, the game will begin! Feel free to procrastinate a bit. And if you’d like to try out Ivy’s Hardest Game, by Carlos Peña-Lobel, head to [http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/26329347/](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/26329347/).

If you’ve no experience (or comfort) whatsoever with programming, rest assured that Gabe’s and Carlos’s projects are more complex than what we expect for this problem. (Click See inside in Scratch’s top-right corner to look at each project’s underlying "implementation details.") But they do reveal what you can do with Scratch.

In fact, for a gentler introduction to Scratch (and programming more generally), you might want to review some of the examples that you may have seen previously (and take a look at a few more), the "source code" for which can be found at [http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/522341/](http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/522341/). Allow Professor David Malan of Harvard's CS50 to take you on a tour, though feel free to forge ahead on your own if you’d prefer:

And you might also want to watch CS50's own Allison’s short on Scratch:

Feel free to download the source code for a few more projects from [http://scratch.mit.edu/explore/projects/all/](http://scratch.mit.edu/explore/projects/all/) or elsewhere. For each program, run it to see how it works overall and then look over its scripts to understand how it works underneath the hood. Feel free to make changes to scripts and observe the effects. Once you can say to yourself, "Okay, I think I get this," you’re ready to proceed.

## It's Adventure Time!

Now it’s time to choose your own adventure!

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jake.gif" width="500">

Your mission is, quite simply, to have fun with Scratch and implement a project of your choice (be it an animation, a game, interactive art, or anything else), subject only to the following requirements (which, to be clear, must all be implemented in order to obtain full points).

1. Your project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.

2. Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).

3. Your project must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.

4. Your project must use at least one custom "define" block.

5. Your project must use at least one sound.

Your project should be more complex than some basic examples, but it can be less complex than, say, Pikachu’s Pastry Catch and Ivy’s Hardest Game. As such, your project should probably use at least a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.

Feel free to peruse additional projects online for inspiration, but your own project should not be terribly similar to any of them. Try to think of an idea on your own, and then set out to implement it. But don’t try to implement the entirety of your project all at once: pluck off one piece at a time. Gabe, for instance, probably implemented just one pastry first, before he moved onto the game’s other sprites. And Carlos probably implemented Yale before he moved on to implementing MIT. In other words, take baby steps: write a bit of code (i.e., drag and drop a few puzzle pieces), test, write a bit more, test, and so forth.

If, along the way, you find it too difficult to implement some feature, try not to fret; alter your design or work around the problem. If you set out to implement an idea that you find fun, you should not find it hard to satisfy this problem’s requirements.

Alright, off you go. Make us proud!

Not quite sure how to begin? Feeling a bit overwhelmed? Not to worry. Join Zamyla for a walkthrough of this problem, if you’d like more of a tour:

Incidentally, if you don’t have the best Internet access, you’re welcome to download Scratch’s "offline editor" at http://scratch.mit.edu/scratch2download/. But when done with your project offline, be sure to upload it to your account at http://scratch.mit.edu/ via ```File > Share``` to website in the offline editor.

## How to Submit

1. On your Scratch editor page (e.g. [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/123456789/#editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/123456789/#editor)), go to the "File" menu and click "Download to your computer". Make sure to save your file with a .sb2 extension!<br>

2. Upload the .sb2 file into the [CS50 IDE](cs50.io).

3. Run the following command `submit50 compsci.one/scratch@spencertiberi/checks`
