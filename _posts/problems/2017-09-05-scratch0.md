# Your first Scratch program

Create a scratch program that has:
- Two different sprites.
- One sprite saying "Hello, world!" for 2 seconds.
- The other sprite saying "Welcome to compsci.one" for 2 seconds after the first one speaks.
- A stage change.
- A costume change.
- A sound.
- A sprite move.
- A sprite rotate.
- A sprite change color.
- A wait block.

Feel free to be creative with this, but be sure that at least everything listed above is satisfied.
