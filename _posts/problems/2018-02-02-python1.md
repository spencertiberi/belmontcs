# Variables

Let's play around with some variables and different data types!

## Problem 0: eight.py

The program **eight.py** is written below. It's supposed to print the number inputted by the user times 8. However, what does it do instead? Copy the code into your own **eight.py** and run it. Then, fix the code so it works as intended. :)

### Source Code

```
num = input("Enter a number: ")
print (num * 8)
```

### Checks

To run checks, run `check50 compsci.one/python1/eight@spencertiberi/checks` in the terminal.

### How to Submit

Head to [CS50.io](cs50.io) Make sure **eight.py** is in your current directory and type `submit50 compsci.one/python1/eight@spencertiberi/checks` in the terminal.
