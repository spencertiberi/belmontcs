# How do you do...

Here's some practice to help you sharpen your pseudocode. In a .txt file named **everyday.txt**, write pseudocode describing how to do the following ordinary, everyday processes. Be specific! You would want to make it so that a stranger could reasonably follow your directions.

1. Brushing your teeth
2. Creating and sending a snap to your friend (You're **NOT** allowed to go through the steps right now! ðŸ‘€)
3. How you get to Belmont Hill from your house in the morning

# How to Submit

Head to [CS50.io](cs50.io) Make sure everyday.txt is in your current directory and type `submit50 compsci.one/everyday@spencertiberi/checks` into the terminal.
