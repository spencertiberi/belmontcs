## You've died of dysentery...

Perhaps you've heard of the classic game *The Oregon Trail*? It's a classic game where you venture across the US to the promise land of the Willamette Valley (Portland, OR)! Along the way you need to make decisions that effect the outcome of the game.

We're going to focus on the text aspect of the *The Oregon Trail* and others like it and create a **choose your own adventure** game! In fact, there used to be a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure" target="blank"> Choose Your Own Adventure</a> books!

## Let's get to choosin'!

The idea is to print text to the screen dictating a story, then ask the user for input. Perhaps the protagonist of the story (the user) is at a fork in the road. Depending on the user's input (if/elif/else), change the story and ask more questions!

You will likely have a "flow" to your story and questions similar to this:

## Specification

Your game must:
1. Have least 12 total possible questions asked of the user
2. Each question must yield at least one result
3. There must be at least 5 different endings to your story
4. Be titled **cyoa.py** for **C**hoose **Y**our **O**wn **A**dventure!
5. You must have fun. It's required!

### How to Submit
