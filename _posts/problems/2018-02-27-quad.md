## Time to work on your quads!

We're going to make a calculator that solves quadratics! We'll recreate the [nifty quadratic formula](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/quadratics/solving-quadratics-using-the-quadratic-formula/a/quadratic-formula-review) to help us!

Odds are you'll find `math.sqrt()` useful! Note: quadratics can have 2, 1, or 0 solutions! In the case of two solutions, that's due to the +/- in the formula. **However, we'll handle both these cases separately!**

## Example Run

```
~/workspace/ $ python quad.py
Value for a: 1
Value for b: 2
Value for c: 0
x1 = 0
x2 = -2
```

```
~/workspace/ $ python quad.py
Value for a: 1
Value for b: 2
Value for c: 1
x1 = -1
x2 = -1
```

## Specification

Your program must:
1. Take in 3 variables as floats
2. Return 2 values (sometimes quadratics only have one solution, so it's okay if they're the same!)

### How to Submit

Head to [CS50.io](cs50.io) Make sure **quad.py** is in your current directory and type `submit50 compsci.one/quad@spencertiberi/checks` in the terminal.
