## Structure and Submission

For all of these problems, use the [CS50 IDE](https://cs50.io) and follow the submission prompts.

**IMPORTANT:** Be sure to name each problem as such _"problem0.py"_, _"problem1.py"_, etc.

To test these problems, run them and play around with different possible input! :)

---

## Problem 0: Fortune Telling
Create a Python script that prompts the user for their name, age, and dream job. Store these in different variables with identifiers (names) of your choosing.

Then, you will want this script to print to the screen a greeting with user's name and that at the user's age in 5 years they will have their dream job.

### Example Run
```
~/workspace/ problem0.py
What is your name? Spencer
What is your age? 27
What is your dream job? NBA Center
Hi Spencer, when you are 32, you will be a NBA Center!
```

### Submission
Head to [CS50.io](cs50.io) Make sure **problem0.py** is in your current directory and type `submit50 compsci.one/review/problem0@spencertiberi/checks` in the terminal.

#### Topics Covered
- variables
- strings
- concatenation
- integers
- simple i/o
- built-in functions

## Problem 1: There's More to Life Than Money... But...
Finish the python script below by implementing the function `chooser` as described by the `TODO`

### Source Code
```python
def chooser(a, b, c):
    #TODO: implement a function that returns the string "first" if a is greatest,
    #"second" if b is greatest, "third" if c is greatest

salary1 = float(input("What is the first job offer? "))
salary2 = float(input("What is the second job offer? "))
salary3 = float(input("What is the third job offer? "))
print("You should take the " + chooser(salary1, salary2, salary3) + " job.")

```

### Example Run
```
~/workspace/ problem1.py
What is the first job offer? 52500.00
What is the second job offer? 49100.50
What is the third job offer? 60700.15
You should take the third job.
```

### Submission
Head to [CS50.io](cs50.io) Make sure **problem1.py** is in your current directory and type `submit50 compsci.one/review/problem1@spencertiberi/checks` in the terminal.

#### Topics Covered
- variables
- strings
- functions
- if/elif/else
- conditions
- return values

## Problem 2: List o' Grades
Create a program that continuously asks a user for numerical grades until the user types `done`. These grades should be appended onto a list (aka array). Once the user is done entering grades, the average of the grades should be printed to the screen.

### Example Run
```
~/workspace/ problem2.py
What was your assignment grade (type done to finish)? 68
What was your assignment grade (type done to finish)? 72
What was your assignment grade (type done to finish)? 92
What was your assignment grade (type done to finish)? 89
What was your assignment grade (type done to finish)? 94
What was your assignment grade (type done to finish)? done
Your average grade is 83
```

### Submission
Head to [CS50.io](cs50.io) Make sure **problem2.py** is in your current directory and type `submit50 compsci.one/review/problem2@spencertiberi/checks` in the terminal.

#### Topics Covered
- variables
- integers
- lists (arrays)
- simple i/o
- while loops
- conditions
