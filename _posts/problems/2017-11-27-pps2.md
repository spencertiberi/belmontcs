## Structure and Submission

For all of these problems, use the [CS50 IDE](https://cs50.io) and download your code into your class Google Drive folder.

**IMPORTANT:** Create a folder in your class Google Drive folder named _"Practice PSET 2"_.

**IMPORTANT:** Be sure to name each problem as such _"problem0.py"_, _"problem1.py"_, etc.

To test these problems, run them and play around with different possible input! :)

## Problem 0: Kazakhstan is the greatest country in the world!
Create a program that opens `borat.txt`, a file you'll need to make, and prints the quotes in the file, line by line. For a refresher on file input/output, [check out this site](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/files/reading-and-writing-files-in-python).

### borat.txt
```
My name-a Borat!
This is Nathalia. [makes out] She's my sister.
Pamela, I am not attracted to you anymore...NOT!
I arrived in America's airport with clothings, US dollars, and a jar of gypsy tears to protect me from AIDS.
May George Bush drink the blood of every man woman and child in Iraq!
```

### Example Run
```
~/workspace/ problem0.py

## Problem 1: Word.
Create a program will allow you to create `.txt` files with titles of your choosing. When ran, your program will ask for a name for the `.txt` file. Nest, it should allow the user to type lines of text until the user types `DONE`. Each line of text should be written to the `.txt` file.

### Example Run
```
~/workspace/ problem1.py
What is the name of the file? drake.txt
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
DONE
```

#### drake.txt
After running the program as described above, the contents of drake.txt should look like the following:
```
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
```

#### Topics Covered
- variables
- integers
- file i/o
- while loops
- conditions
