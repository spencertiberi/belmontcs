# How do you do...

Here's some practice to help you sharpen your pseudocode. In a Google Doc, write pseudocode describing how to do the following ordinary, everyday processes. Be specific!

1. Brushing your teeth
2. Checking your friends' stories on Snapchat (You're **NOT** allowed to go through the steps right now! üëÄ)
3. Making a PB&J sandwich

# How to Submit

Share the Google Doc to [tiberi@belmonthill.org](mailto:tiberi@belmonthill.org). üòÅ
