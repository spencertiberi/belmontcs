## Problem 0: One Guess
Create a program called **guess1.py** asks the user to guess a number. The number the user is trying to guess is 37. If the user guesses too high, too low, or gets it, let the user know like below!

### Example Run
```
~/workspace/ $ guess1.py
Guess the number: 17
Too low!
~/workspace/ $ guess1.py
Guess the number: 61
Too high!
~/workspace/ $ guess1.py
Guess the number: 37
You got it!
```

### Checks

To run checks, run `check50 compsci.one/python3/guess1@spencertiberi/checks` in the terminal.

### How to Submit

Head to [CS50.io](cs50.io) Make sure **guess1.py** is in your current directory and type `submit50 compsci.one/python3/guess1@spencertiberi/checks` in the terminal.

## Problem 1: hour2.py

Write a program called **hour2.py** that asks for the current hour, a number of hours to pass, and then prints the time after. Only the numbers 1-12 should be used for hours (HINT: % 12 will limit to 0-11, but 0 is equivalent to 0... Hmm...)

### Example Run

```
./hour2.py
What hour is it? 9
How many hours will pass? 6
In 6 hours it will be 3 o'clock
```

### Checks

To run checks, run `check50 compsci.one/python3/hour2@spencertiberi/checks` in the terminal.

### How to Submit

Head to [CS50.io](cs50.io) Make sure **hour2.py** is in your current directory and type `submit50 compsci.one/python3/hour2@spencertiberi/checks` in the terminal.

## Problem 2: truth.py

Write a program called **truth.py** that prints values of various conditions based on two user-inputed Boolean values.

### Example Run

```
A (true or false): true
B (true or false): false

A and B: false
A or B: true
Not A: false
Not B: true
```

### Checks

To run checks, run `check50 compsci.one/python3/truth@spencertiberi/checks` in the terminal.

### How to Submit

Head to [CS50.io](cs50.io) Make sure **truth.py** is in your current directory and type `submit50 compsci.one/python3/truth@spencertiberi/checks` in the terminal.
