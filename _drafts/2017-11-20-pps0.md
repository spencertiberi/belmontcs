## Structure and Submission

For all of these problems, use the [CS50 IDE](https://cs50.io) and download your code into your class Google Drive folder.

**IMPORTANT:** Create a folder in your class Google Drive folder named _"Practice PSET 0"_.

**IMPORTANT:** Be sure to name each problem as such _"problem0.py"_, _"problem1.py"_, etc.

To test these problems, run them and play around with different possible input! :)

## Problem 0: Fortune Telling
Create a Python script that prompts the user for their name, age, and dream job. Store these in different variables with identifiers (names) of your choosing.

Then, you will want this script to print to the screen a greeting with user's name and that at the user's age in 5 years they will have their dream job.

### Example Run
```
~/workspace/ problem0.py
What is your name? Spencer
What is your age? 26
What is your dream job? NBA Center
Hi Spencer, when you are 31, you will be a NBA Center!
```

#### Topics Covered
- variables
- strings
- concatenation
- integers
- simple i/o
- built-in functions

## Problem 1: Guessing Game
Create a program that generates a random number between 1-50, stores it in a variable, and asks the user to guess the value. The program should continuously prompt the user until he or she get's the number right, telling him/her if too high or too low. Once the correct number is entered, the program should print _"You got it"_ and the number of attempts it took.

### Example Run
```
~/workspace/ problem1.py
Guess the number: 17
Too Low!
Guess the number: 45
Too High!
Guess the number: 27
Too Low!
Guess the number: 33
Too High!
Guess the number: 31
You got it! And it only took you 5 tries!
```

#### Topics Covered
- variables
- integers
- simple i/o
- random number generation
- import
- conditions
- if/elif/else
- while loops

## Problem 2: I Can't Even...
Create a problem that, using a for loop, prints the numbers 1 through 15, line by line, with a string noting if the integer is even or odd.

**Hint:** `5 % 2 == 1`, `4 % 2 == 0`, `15 % 2 == 1`, and `8 % 2 == 0`

### Example Run
```
~/workspace/ problem1.py
1 odd
2 even
3 odd
4 even
5 odd
6 even
7 odd
8 even
9 odd
10 even
11 odd
12 even
13 odd
14 even
15 odd
```

#### Topics Covered
- variables
- integers
- simple i/o
- for loops
- if conditions
- modulus arithmetic
