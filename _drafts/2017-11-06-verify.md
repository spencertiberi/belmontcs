## Problem
The user is solving some basic addition problems, and wants to make sure he got the correct result. The below problem promps the user for the three integers: the two s/he is adding, followed by the result s/he got. Write a function `verify` that takes in these three integers and returns either `True` or `False`, depending on whether or not he solved the problem correctly. If `True`, print "correct!" to the screen, else print "incorrect!"

## Distribution Code
```python
# TODO: create verifier function

# get input from user
x = int(input("Enter the first int you are adding: "))
y = int(input("Enter the second int you are adding: "))
z = int(input("Enter the result: "))

# TODO: verify the result using the function you wrote, and print 'correct!' or 'incorrect!'
```
