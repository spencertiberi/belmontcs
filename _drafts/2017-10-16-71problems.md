Question 2:

Write a program that asks the user to enter a single character and then outputs the ASCII number of that character. Please follow the same format as in the sample run.

Try it: What happens if you type in a word like paper?

Sample Run
```
Enter a character: %
ASCII #37

Enter a character: 8
ASCII #56
```

Question 3:

In the last problem we get an error if we enter more than one character at a time. Rewrite the program so that it only calls the chr method if a single character is entered.

Sample Run
```
Enter a character: *
ASCII #42

Enter a character: exit
Not a character
```
