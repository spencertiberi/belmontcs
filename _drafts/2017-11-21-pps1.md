## Structure and Submission

For all of these problems, use the [CS50 IDE](https://cs50.io) and download your code into your class Google Drive folder.

**IMPORTANT:** Create a folder in your class Google Drive folder named _"Practice PSET 1"_.

**IMPORTANT:** Be sure to name each problem as such _"problem0.py"_, _"problem1.py"_, etc.

To test these problems, run them and play around with different possible input! :)

## Problem 0: There's More to Life Than Money... But...
Finish the python script below by implementing the function `chooser` as described by the `TODO`

### Source Code
```python
def chooser(a, b, c):
    #TODO: implement a function that returns the string "first" if a is greatest,
    #"second" if b is greatest, "third" if c is greatest

salary1 = float(input("What is the first job offer? "))
salary2 = float(input("What is the second job offer? "))
salary3 = float(input("What is the third job offer? "))
print("You should take the " + chooser(salary1, salary2, salary3) + " job.")

```

### Example Run
```
~/workspace/ problem0.py
What is the first job offer? 52500.00
What is the second job offer? 49100.50
What is the third job offer? 60700.15

## Problem 1: List o' Grades
Create a program that continuously asks a user for numerical grades until the user types `done`. These grades should be appended onto a list (aka array). Once the user is done entering grades, the average of the grades should be printed to the screen.

### Example Run
```
~/workspace/ problem1.py
What was your assignment grade (type done to finish)? 68
What was your assignment grade (type done to finish)? 72
What was your assignment grade (type done to finish)? 92
What was your assignment grade (type done to finish)? 89
What was your assignment grade (type done to finish)? 94
What was your assignment grade (type done to finish)? done
Your average grade is 83
```

#### Topics Covered
- variables
- integers
- lists (arrays)
- simple i/o
- while loops
- conditions
