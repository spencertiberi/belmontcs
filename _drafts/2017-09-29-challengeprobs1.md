# Challenge Problems

Work on these in the [CS50 IDE](cs50.io). If you need help navigating and using the CS50 IDE, check [this nifty how-to guide on all things CS50](https://manual.cs50.net/)!

## Problem 1: Calculator

Create a calculator in Python! Be sure to support addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponents!

Example Output:
```
What is your first number? 5
What operation do you want? *
What is your second number? 2.5
5 * 2.5 = 12.5
```

### Submission
1. Save as **calculator.py**
2. Right click or two-finger click to download file from your IDE.
3. Save **calculator.py** in your google drive.

## Problem 2: Schedule

Create a program that prompts the user for day of the week and time of day (hours and minutes in military time) and determines if the user is supposed to be in school at BH (assume an 8:00 am to 4:45 pm schedule).

Example Output:
```
What day is it? Friday
What time is it (hours)? 10
What time is it (minutes)? 30
You should be in class, my boi!
```

### Submission
1. Save as **schedule.py**
2. Right click or two-finger click to download file from your IDE.
