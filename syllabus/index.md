## Academic Honesty
The academic honesty policy of compsci.one mirrors that of Harvard's introduction to CS course, CS50.  It can be summed up as "be reasonable."
- You may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you.
- Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code to others, but you may not view theirs.

For detailed information about the course's academic honesty policy, see the following:

- [Harvard's CS50 Academic Honesty Policy](http://docs.cs50.net/2016/fall/syllabus/cs50.html#academic-honesty)
